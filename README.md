W1. 
* [Synthetic time-series data](C4/W1/ungraded_labs/C4_W1_Lab_1_time_series.ipynb)
    * plotted to illustrate key concepts
    * helpful for testing ML algorithms down the line
* [Baseline forecasts](C4/W1/ungraded_labs/C4_W1_Lab_2_forecasting.ipynb)
    * experiment with some baseline predictions (e.g., native forecast, moving average, differencing)
    * troubleshoot with metrics functions due to tensorflow versions (solutions in notebook)
